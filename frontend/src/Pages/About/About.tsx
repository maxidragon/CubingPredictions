              How it works?
            </Typography>
            <Typography>
              The website uses a public API provided by WCA to retrieve
              competition data. You can find the competitions that interest you
              and try to predict who will make it to the podium in each event.
              Currently, you can only select competitors who have a WCA ID. If
              you correctly predict all three individuals, you will receive 20
              points. In the case of two correct predictions, you will receive
              15 points. If you correctly predict one person, you will receive
              10 points. If you have two correct predictions but in the wrong
              order, you will receive 5 points. If none of the individuals
              match, you will receive 0 points. You can make predictions after
              the registration closes until the start of the respective final.
              Currently, it is not possible to change your selections, but in
              the future, it will be allowed with a lower point reward. In the
              future, there will likely be more prediction options, with a focus
              on record predictions.
